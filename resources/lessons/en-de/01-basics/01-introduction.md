# Welcome to German! (Willkommen zum Deutschen!)

In this first lesson, we'll learn some basic German greetings and pronunciation rules. German might look challenging at first, but with practice, you'll find it's very logical and structured.

## Basic Greetings

Here are some essential German greetings:

| English | German | Pronunciation |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Hello | Hallo | HAL-oh |
| Good morning | Guten Morgen | GOO-ten MOR-gen |
| Good day | Guten Tag | GOO-ten TAHG |
| Good evening | Guten Abend | GOO-ten AH-bent |

## Practice Exercise

Try matching these greetings with their meanings:

1. Match the greeting with the appropriate time of day:
   - Guten Morgen
   - Guten Tag
   - Guten Abend

Remember: German nouns are always capitalized!
