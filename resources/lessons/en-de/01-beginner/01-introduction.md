# Welcome to German! (Willkommen zum Deutschen!)
In this first lesson, we'll learn some basic German greetings and pronunciation rules. German might look challenging at first, but with practice, you'll find it's very logical and structured.

## Basic Greetings
Here are some essential German greetings:

| English         | German       | Pronunciation      |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Hello           | Hallo        | HAL-oh            |
| Good morning    | Guten Morgen | GOO-ten MOR-gen   |
| Good day        | Guten Tag    | GOO-ten TAHG      |
| Good evening    | Guten Abend  | GOO-ten AH-bent   |

> **Tip:** German nouns are always capitalized!

## Practice Exercise: Build the Word
Now it's time to practice spelling some of these greetings! Rearrange the letters to spell the correct German word.

<WordBuilder targetWord="Guten Morgen" nativeWord="Good morning" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Hallo" nativeWord="Hello" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Guten Tag" nativeWord="Good day" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Guten Abend" nativeWord="Good evening" />

## Matching Exercise
Match the following greetings with their meanings:
1. Match the greeting with the appropriate time of day:
   - Guten Morgen
   - Guten Tag
   - Guten Abend

## Pronunciation Practice
Practice saying the following phrase in German:

<VoiceRecorder text="Guten Morgen" nativeAudio="../../courses/en-de/_shared/guten_morgen.mp3" />

**Hint:** Think about when you would use each greeting during the day!
