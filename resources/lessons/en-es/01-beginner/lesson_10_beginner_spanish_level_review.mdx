¡Bienvenidos! Welcome to the Beginner Spanish Level Review! Let's refresh your Spanish knowledge with a quick recap of key concepts. We'll cover essential vocabulary and grammar to boost your confidence.

Let's start with greetings:

*   **Hola** - Hello
*   **Buenos días** - Good morning
*   **Buenas tardes** - Good afternoon
*   **Buenas noches** - Good evening/Good night

Now, let's review some basic introductions:

*   **Me llamo...** - My name is... (e.g., Me llamo Ana.)
*   **¿Cómo te llamas?** - What's your name? (informal)
*   **¿Cómo se llama?** - What's your name? (formal)
*   **Mucho gusto** - Nice to meet you.
*   **El gusto es mío** - The pleasure is mine.
*   **Soy de...** - I am from... (e.g., Soy de México.)
*   **¿De dónde eres?** - Where are you from?

Finally, let's remember some farewells:

*   **Adiós** - Goodbye
*   **Hasta luego** - See you later
*   **Hasta mañana** - See you tomorrow


## Fundamentals Review
Let's dive into some fundamental Spanish to get you back in the groove!

We'll quickly review basic grammar rules and sentence structure.

*   **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The verb must match the subject in number (singular or plural).

    *   *Yo hablo español.* (I speak Spanish.)
    *   *Nosotros hablamos español.* (We speak Spanish.)

*   **Gender and Number Agreement:** Nouns and adjectives must agree in gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural).

    *   *El libro rojo.* (The red book - masculine singular)
    *   *Los libros rojos.* (The red books - masculine plural)
    *   *La casa blanca.* (The white house - feminine singular)
    *   *Las casas blancas.* (The white houses - feminine plural)

*   **Word Order:** The typical word order in Spanish is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO), but it's more flexible than in English.

    *   *Yo como pizza.* (I eat pizza.)
    *   *María lee un libro.* (Maria reads a book.)

Here are some examples of basic sentence structures:

*   **Simple Sentences:**

    *   *El sol brilla.* (The sun shines.)
    *   *Ella canta.* (She sings.)
    *   *Juan trabaja.* (Juan works.)
    *   *Nosotros estudiamos.* (We study.)
    *   *Ellos bailan.* (They dance.)
    *   *Yo corro.* (I run.)

*   **Sentences with Adjectives:**

    *   *El perro es pequeño.* (The dog is small.)
    *   *La flor es hermosa.* (The flower is beautiful.)
    *   *El carro es rápido.* (The car is fast.)
    *   *La casa es grande.* (The house is big.)
    *   *El cielo es azul.* (The sky is blue.)
    *   *El café es caliente.* (The coffee is hot.)

<HighlightableText highlights='[{"word":"Yo","info":"I (subject pronoun)"},{"word":"como","info":"I eat (present tense of comer)"},{"word":"pizza","info":"pizza"}]'>
Yo como pizza.
</HighlightableText>

<SentenceBreakdown sentence="Yo quiero comer pizza.">
  <Part part="Yo" explanation="I (subject pronoun)" />
  <Part part="quiero" explanation="I want (present tense of querer)" />
  <Part part="comer" explanation="to eat (infinitive)" />
  <Part part="pizza" explanation="pizza" />
</SentenceBreakdown>

Let's review some key points:

*   Nouns have gender (masculine or feminine).
*   Adjectives usually follow the noun.
*   Verb conjugation changes based on the subject pronoun.

Remember these basics, and you'll be ready to tackle more complex Spanish!


## Pronunciation Practice
Let's refine your Spanish pronunciation with focused exercises!

First, let's work on vowel sounds. Listen carefully to these words:

*   **Casa** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/casa.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (House)
*   **Sol** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/sol.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Sun)
*   **Luna** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/luna.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Moon)
*   **Vino** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/vino.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Wine)
*   **Azul** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/azul.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Blue)
*   **Perro** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/perro.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Dog)
*   **Gato** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/gato.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Cat)
*   **Flor** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/flor.mp3" miniPlayer={true}/> (Flower)

<TipBox>
Pay attention to how open or closed your mouth is for each vowel. Spanish vowels are generally pure and consistent.
</TipBox>

Now, practice common phrases. Record your voice and compare it to the native speaker:

*   **Hola, ¿cómo estás?** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/hola_como_estas.mp3" /> (Hello, how are you?)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Hola, ¿cómo estás?" nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/hola_como_estas.mp3" />
*   **Buenos días.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenos_dias.mp3" /> (Good morning.)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Buenos días." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenos_dias.mp3" />
*   **Buenas tardes.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenas_tardes.mp3" /> (Good afternoon.)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Buenas tardes." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenas_tardes.mp3" />
*   **Buenas noches.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenas_noches.mp3" /> (Good evening/night.)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Buenas noches." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/buenas_noches.mp3" />
*   **Mucho gusto.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/mucho_gusto.mp3" /> (Nice to meet you.)
     <VoiceRecorder text="Mucho gusto." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/mucho_gusto.mp3" />
*   **¿Cómo te llamas?** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/como_te_llamas.mp3" /> (What's your name?)
    <VoiceRecorder text="¿Cómo te llamas?" nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/como_te_llamas.mp3" />
*   **Me llamo...** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/me_llamo.mp3" /> (My name is...)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Me llamo..." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/me_llamo.mp3" />
*   **Por favor.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/por_favor.mp3" /> (Please.)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Por favor." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/por_favor.mp3" />
*   **Gracias.** <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/gracias.mp3" /> (Thank you.)
    <VoiceRecorder text="Gracias." nativeAudio="/src/assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/review/audio/gracias.mp3" />

<TipBox>
Don't be afraid to exaggerate the sounds initially to train your mouth muscles. Over time, your pronunciation will become more natural.
</TipBox>


## Vocabulary Consolidation
Strengthening your vocabulary is crucial. Let's explore some effective methods:

**Memory Aids (Mnemonic Devices)**

Mnemonics can turn abstract words into memorable phrases or images.

*   **Example 1:** *Ser* (to be) - Use "DOCTOR" (Description, Occupation, Characteristic, Time, Origin, Relationship).
<Mnemonic content="Ser: DOCTOR (Description, Occupation, Characteristic, Time, Origin, Relationship)." />
*   **Example 2:** *Estar* (to be) - Use "PLACE" (Position, Location, Action, Condition, Emotion).
<Mnemonic content="Estar: PLACE (Position, Location, Action, Condition, Emotion)." />

**Word Building**

Spanish words often share roots. Understanding these can help you guess the meaning of new words.

*   **Prefixes:** *Re-* (again), *Des-* (un-), *In-* (not).
    *   Example: *Hacer* (to do), *Rehacer* (to redo).
    *   Example: *Afortunado* (fortunate), *Desafortunado* (unfortunate).
    *   Example: *Posible* (possible), *Imposible* (impossible).
*   **Suffixes:** *-ción* (noun), *-oso/a* (adjective), *-mente* (adverb).
    *   Example: *Comunicar* (to communicate), *Comunicación* (communication).
    *   Example: *Peligro* (danger), *Peligroso/a* (dangerous).
    *   Example: *Rápido* (quick), *Rápidamente* (quickly).

**Practice Time**

Let's solidify your understanding with a word-building exercise.

<WordBuilder targetWord="Rehacer" nativeWord="To redo" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Desafortunado" nativeWord="Unfortunate" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Comunicación" nativeWord="Communication" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Peligroso" nativeWord="Dangerous" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Rápidamente" nativeWord="Quickly" />
<WordBuilder targetWord="Imposible" nativeWord="Impossible" />

<TipBox>
    Pay attention to the context in which a word is used.

## Tips and Tricks
Here are some useful tips and tricks to accelerate your Spanish learning:

*   **Immerse Yourself:** Surround yourself with the Spanish language as much as possible.

    *   Watch Spanish-language movies and TV shows with subtitles.
        *   Example: Watch "La Casa de Papel" (Money Heist) with Spanish audio and English subtitles, then gradually switch to Spanish subtitles.
        *   Example: Watch "Club de Cuervos", a comedy based in México.
    *   Listen to Spanish music and podcasts.
        *   Example: Listen to Shakira, a famous singer from Colombia.
        *   Example: Listen to "Radio Ambulante", a podcast with stories from all over Latin America.
    *   Change your phone and social media settings to Spanish.

*   **Focus on High-Frequency Words:** Learn the most commonly used words first. This will allow you to understand a large percentage of everyday conversations.

    *   Example: Start with words like *ser*, *estar*, *tener*, *hacer*, *ir*, *decir*, *ver*, *dar*, *saber*, and *querer*.
    *   Example: Learn common greetings like "Hola," "¿Cómo estás?," "Buenos días," "Buenas tardes," and "Buenas noches."

*   **Practice Speaking Early and Often:** Don't be afraid to make mistakes! The more you speak, the more comfortable and confident you'll become.

    *   Example: Practice with a native speaker through language exchange apps or websites.
    *   Example: Record yourself speaking and listen back to identify areas for improvement.
    *   Example: Say simple phrases aloud, even if you're just talking to yourself.
        *   Example: "Tengo hambre" (I'm hungry).
        *   Example: "Quiero agua" (I want water).
        *   Example: "Necesito dormir" (I need to sleep).

*   **Use Flashcards and Spaced Repetition:** These techniques are effective for memorizing vocabulary and grammar rules.

    *   Example: Use Anki or Quizlet to create and review flashcards.

*   **Find a Language Partner or Tutor:** Having someone to practice with and receive feedback from can be invaluable.

    *   Example: Look for a language exchange partner online or in your local community.
    *   Example: Consider hiring a tutor for personalized instruction and guidance.

*   **Set Realistic Goals:** Don't try to learn everything at once. Break down your learning into smaller, manageable goals.

    *   Example: Aim to learn 10 new words per week.
    *   Example: Focus on mastering one grammar concept at a time.

*   **Don't Just Study Grammar:** Learn grammar in context.

    *   Example: Instead of memorizing verb conjugations in isolation, learn them through sentences you find interesting.

<TipBox>
Here's a tip: Don't be afraid to make mistakes. It's part of the learning process!
</TipBox>

*   **Use Mnemonics:** Create memory aids to remember vocabulary.

    *   Example: To remember "embarazada" (pregnant), think of "embarrassed" because it can be an embarrassing situation.

*   **Learn with Music:** Music is a fun way to learn new vocabulary and improve your pronunciation.

    *   Example: Listen to Spanish songs and try to sing along, paying attention to the lyrics.
    *   Example: Look up the lyrics and translations of your favorite songs.
